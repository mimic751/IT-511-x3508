I took my last assignment I made and added a class to it. I then threw my code from the last stepping stone in and had to change it a bit to make it work with the class.
This is definately where the tires hit the road. In other languages we are basically creating functions they are jnust called methods here. What I like about java is that it constructs a bunch of functions into a class. Python can kind of do that, but not as well. probably why its so slow.

this really set me on my path to do my final.

Ill be honest I didnt download the old file. I just started working off the file in my IDE

some changes if I spent more time on this would be to split the list and select method into two
